# editor

A basic text editor to learn McClim, roughly following [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/vg1jG-NTNHc).

## Installation

You need an installation of sbcl. If you clone this repository to your `quicklisp/local-projects` you can just do

````
* (ql:quickload :editor)
````

Then `(editor:run)` to start the editor or `(editor:make)` to create a binary.
